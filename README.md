# Capstone-Project_1-Hotel-Booking-Analysis
Analyzing important factors that govern the bookings

![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/rainbow.png)

## **Problem Statement**
Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? Or the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate? What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests? This hotel booking dataset can help you explore those questions!

This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data. </b>

# üìã**Summary**

This project is aimed at performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a hotel bookings dataset. Exploratory Data Analysis is a key part of any machine learning project. Performing an EDA helps a Data Scientist understand the data in depth. The data comprises of various columns such as types of hotels, countries, stays, average daily rate etc.

The data was first cleaned before analyzing it to find details. Data cleaning mainly comprised of null value handling.

The libraries that are used in this project are:

1. Pandas
2. Matplotlib
3. Seaborn These libraries helped in data handling and visualization.
